    <h2>Publication history</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Politics and economics</h3>
    <p>
      Iron Man was more overtly political than other Silver Age Marvel
      characters.[131] Lee wrote the character to represent liberal capitalism,
      fighting against communism and other anti-democratic
      forces.[132][133][134] Though anti-communist sentiments were present
      throughout Marvel Comics, they appeared most prominently in Iron Man
      stories.[135] After Marvel shifted away from addressing foreign conflicts
      toward the end of the 1960s, Iron Man was portrayed as a liberal who was
      skeptical of the U.S. government, yet also opposed radicalism; at the time
      associated with 1960s counterculture.[136] Marvel portrayed Iron Man as
      more self-doubting, questioning when the use of force is justified against
      communism.[137][138] By 1975, Iron Man opposed the Vietnam War,[136] which
      gave the character a new motivation in making up for his promotion of
      violence in the past.[139] Iron Man's use of his vast resources as a
      protector was reframed as a cautionary tale, in which these resources
      could be co-opted to do harm. His motivation for providing weapons to the
      government was retroactively changed so Stark only got involved because he
      believed it would end the war more quickly.[140] Over time, writers
      portrayed Iron Man as a philanthropist.[141]
    </p>
    <h3>Technology</h3>
    <p>
      Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man
      stories,[29][145] and various writers have portrayed him as a
      technological marvel since his earliest appearances.[146] The character's
      use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and as Iron Man,
      explores problems that arise from progress and advancement,[147] including
      misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics.[148] Iron Man's
      position within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus
      human oversight of technology,[149] and it reflects the debate on how new
      technologies are incorporated into public and military use, including the
      use of exoskeletons and battle suits.[150] These technological themes are
      explored through a modern lens during the "Extremis" story arc, which
      incorporates the idea of human enhancement through
      biotechnology.[151][152]

    <h2>Supporting characters</h2>
    <p>
      Pepper Potts is a Stark Industries employee who Stark promoted to his
      executive assistant.[174] The original portrayal of the character was that
      of a simple love interest and damsel in distress.[114] She came to manage
      the business herself, as Stark had little interest in his
      responsibilities.[174] When Stark became Iron Man and took responsibility
      for his company, she taught him how to manage the business.[89] When
      Pepper was injured by an explosion and received a heart injury similar to
      Iron Man's, he installed the arc reactor technology in her.[175] She
      eventually became the CEO of Stark Industries.[176] Iron Man secretly
      worked on a suit of armor to be powered by her arc reactor, and she
      discovered it in a Stark Industries lab while she had control of the
      company. Taking the armor, she became the superhero Rescue.[177]
